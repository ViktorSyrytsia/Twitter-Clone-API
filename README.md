##  Twitter-Clone-API
Education project from JSP Summer camp
A simple implementation of the REST API, which simulates the work of Twitter, with all CRUD operations.
Where you can create tweets, comment, follow users, add media files, etc.

## The technology that I used:

  * Express
  * Typescript
  * Typegoose to define Mongoose models using TypeScript classes
  * InversifyJS to identify and inject dependencies and follow best OOP and IoC practices
  * Mongo DB to save basic data
  * Nodemailer
  * JWT authorization
  * Swagger to auto generated docs
  
 ## Commands:
  * npm start:watch - to run compile and start app in dev 
  * npm start:prod - to create build
  * npm lint:fix - to run tslint
